        <h2>Cameron Briggs</h2>
        <div class="flex-child">
            <p>Hi y'all!  My name is Cameron Briggs. I was born, raised and now rooted in Malta, Idaho.  I love learning all around.  I have led many religion-based virtual book clubs since 2020 and am currently teaching Biblical Hebrew.  I'm not much of a sports or entertainment person.  My dream vacation is the annual Education Week down to Provo.  About 5 years ago I was given a family history calling which kicked off my love for genealogy.  I found it extremely difficult as a stake consultant, to get trained to a level to help those other consultants in my stake.  Endless boring hours of reading and more reading which never was quite helpful.  My goal in life is to help bridge the gap between the boomer-genealogy and millennial-genealogy and make learning family history engaging for the upcoming generations.  I've presented the past couple of years at RootsTech on this subject, especially community linking.    I dropped out of school back in the day (because of great job) and now I'm back to finally finish up a Bachelor's degree so people will take me seriously :)</p>
            <h2>Family History</h2>
            <p>I remember exactly where I was sitting on the Rexburg campus in the Taylor chapel when I was sitting through a presentation on the future of family history in 2007.  The speaker said something along the lines of, "Soon we'll email YOU when we find your ancestors!"  I wondered how in the world that would be possible.  Looking back I smile because that was only the beginning of a new age.  As a consultant the two biggest hurdles I encounter are:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>My tree is already done.  My aunt Sally already did it all and there's nothing left to do.</li>
                <li>I don't want to mess anything up and get yelled at. </li>
                </ul>

            <p>I love what two of the labs at BYU are doing to help clear these hurdles.  Source linking and community projects, in my opinion, are the greatest needs we have at this moment.  And technology is making it possible for younger people to do genuine genealogy and join the ranks, i.e. Reverse Indexing.  If there's ever a challenge to be had while working with the global tree, there's either a tool for that or one can be made!  While I see the dangers of AI very clearly, I'm excited to see how the Lord inspires us to ramp up the gathering in the coming years.  I seen some very exciting presentations at Ed Week this year that opened my eyes to some interesting developments already underway.  If we truly are to link all of God's children together in such a short time, we're going to need some help.  As Joe Price says, "Let the humans do what they do best and let the computers do what they do best."</p>
            <p>I've honestly never even thought to pray for technology advancements as suggested in the prompt.  Adding that to my dailies!</p>

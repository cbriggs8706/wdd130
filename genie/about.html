                <p>Hi! I'm Cameron Briggs from Malta, Idaho. Im super passionate about a lot of things. My two great loves are family history and learning. For the past 6 years I've served in family history callings; three years as a stake lead and three years as a ward lead. I currently serve as ward clerk and as a worker in the Twin Falls Temple (soon to be Burley!) I love attending BYU Ed Week and Sperry Symposium each year and lead lots of book clubs in my free time. I've also recently started teaching Beginning Biblical Hebrew online.</p>
                <p>My good friend Jamie and I have started an annual mini RootsTech in our neck of the woods. Each winter we facilitate a large expo for our 15 stake area. Each year grows larger. We have outgrown our normal stake building and are moving to a local college building for 2024. Our goal this year is to reach the broader community and make this a non-denominational and multi-lingual event.</p>

        <p>I work as an application developer for a local milk processing facility and am expanding my skillset with new languages and frameworks like React, NextJS, MongoDB, TypeScript etc. These have given me a new drive to develop genealogy apps such as Genie Greenie where my previous skillset ended at Wordpress.</p>
        <p>I've had the opportunity to present at RootsTech twice. It's been amazing to network and connect with new people and see the world of genealogy in a much broader setting. I teach regular, almost daily, classes at the local FamilySearch center in Burley and am always working to refine the way I teach concepts. I love A/B testing new classes and helping someone truly connect with the spirit of Elijah. Their excitement is contagious and propels me forward. My only problem is time! That's why I'm seeking help. Click here to find out how you might be able to contribute to this project.</p>

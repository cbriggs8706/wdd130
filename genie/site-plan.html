      <h4>The Current Situation</h4>
      <p>A few years ago, I received my first Family History calling.  The learning curve I experienced was brutal!  Locals were only able to help during the day which didn&apos;t work because I had a full time job.  I found the lack of free and engaging content incredibly frustrating. Many hours were spent watching long and often boring tutorial videos. While they do have great information, it was such a chore to keep motivated.
      </p>
        <p>As a stake consultant I would always ask the ward consultants how they learned how to do genealogy. The overwhelming response was something akin to pulling teeth. Many said that If it wasn&apos;t for the spirit of Elijah, they wouldn&apos;t have kept going. I find it alarming that there are so few accredited institutions in this specific field and they all seem to be safeguarding the training practices. You either have to relocate or have a lot of money or want to do it professionally in order to actually get access to the resources that you need to succeed. 
      </p>
        <p>Another pain point for many beginners is that genealogy is such a wide field. It is nearly impossible for one solo person to be involved in every single aspect that genealogy provides. I believe in developing microskills. I&apos;ve found that as we become masters of individual skills, we gain the confidence and excitement to keep going. 
        </p>
          <p>For example, in order to index a batch of records successfully one needs to have a certain set of micro skills like paleography, psychology, sociology, geography, history etc.  Anyone can sit down and plug away at it with guesses. But in order to truly be successful, quick, and efficient, micro skills are necessary. I&apos;ve seen that many of these skills are not being taught in our system today; at least not effectively at the public level. This is why it will be so crucial in the days ahead to have access to  quality training materials and valuable resources for youth and adults completely free. 
        </p>
        <h4>What Needs to Change</h4>
        <p>One of my major inspirations is Joe Price with the BYU Record Linking Lab who has done extensive work at bringing genealogy into the new age. Tools such as the Map App, PowerLinker, Reverse Indexing, and others have really made big strides in helping all age groups develop a new love for genealogy.  This presentation <link> changed my whole trajectory. I found his &apos;10 X&apos; concept very motivating. I believe that there is a great need to hasten this work and his presentation is a great motivator that seems very possible.
        </p>
          <p>I think that we have a duty to revamp the way that we look at genealogical training. And rebuild it from the ground up. My goal in life is to bridge the gap between Boomer-genealogy and Millennial-genealogy. Rather than constantly fight against new trends, I think we need to embrace the shortened attention spans and use technology to its fullest.  Let the computer do what it does best and let the humans do what they do best.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi! I&apos;m Cameron Briggs from Malta, Idaho.  Im super passionate about a lot of things. My two great loves are family history and learning. For the past 6 years I&apos;ve served in family history callings; three years as a stake lead and three years as a ward lead.  I currently serve as ward clerk and as a worker in the Twin Falls Temple (soon to be Burley!)  I love attending BYU Ed Week and Sperry Symposium each year and lead lots of book clubs in my free time.  I&apos;ve also recently started teaching Beginning Biblical Hebrew online.
        </p>
       <p> My good friend Jamie and I have started an annual mini RootsTech in our neck of the woods.  Each winter we facilitate a large expo for our 15 stake area.  Each year grows larger.  We have outgrown our normal stake building and are moving to a local college building for 2024.  Our goal this year is to reach the broader community and make this a non-denominational and multi-lingual event.
        </p>
      <p> I work as an application developer for a local milk processing facility and am expanding my skillset with new languages and frameworks like React, NextJS, MongoDB, TypeScript etc. These have given me a new drive to develop genealogy apps such as Genie Greenie where my previous skillset ended at Wordpress.
        </p>
     <p>I&apos;ve had the opportunity to present at RootsTech twice.  It&apos;s been amazing to network and connect with new people and see the world of genealogy in a much broader setting.  I teach regular, almost daily, classes at the local FamilySearch center in Burley and am always working to refine the way I teach concepts.  I love A/B testing new classes and helping someone truly connect with the spirit of Elijah. Their excitement is contagious and propels me forward.  My only problem is time!  That&apos;s why I&apos;m seeking help.  Click here to find out how you might be able to contribute to this project.

      <h3>Contribute</h3>
      <h4>The dream</h4>
        <p>The ideal app would be based on a zion-model where we have many contributors volunteering their expertise to the world. I would like to have the training self-paced with all restrictions and stumbling blocks removed.  It needs to be mobile first and desktop second. As a consultant, the bane of my existence is password recovery. I wish that we lived in a world where we didn’t even need passwords. So I would like to build this app with all training being open access. Some features like progress tracking will obviously need an authentication piece. But I don’t want any of the training to be hindered by a lost or forgotten password. I believe in building Zion right here and right now. I do not want to charge money or giveaway certain liberties to the whims of advertising. I want this to be ad free, password free, and hassle free.
        </p>
      <h4>Why I think it will work</h4>
        <p>I created a video series to test out my theories on this method. It is proven to be quite successful in helping others learn how to link sources in FamilySearch. Genie Greenie now is the brainchild to take that trial run and apply it to the rest of the family history field.
        </p>
        <h4>How do we get there</h4>
        <p>My dream is daunting at best for a large army. I&apos;m just myself. And I need your help!  Do you have the skills to help program the apps? Do you have the funding to help recruit? Do you have the social connections to help advertise?  More info to come.
